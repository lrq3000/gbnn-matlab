%
% concurrent_disequilibrium is a disambiguation trick in the concurrent case, it helps a great deal with the performance by trying to find only one clique at a time (thus this will multiply the number of iterations: if iterations == 4 and concurrent_cliques == 3, you will have a total 4*3=12 iterations if you enable concurrent_disequilibrium), but that's a small price to pay! Also note that you need to set iterations > 1 to get any beneficial effect from the disequilibrium (iterations = 4 is good).

            % NOTE2: always set gamma = 1 this will give you the best performances, because when gamma == 0, fanals initially activated will have a lower score than others, because they can't stimulate themselves. Eg: if fanals A and B are connected to C and D, and if A and B are initially activated, the scores with gamma = 0 will be as follows: A:1, B:1, C:2, D:2 because A is only stimulated by B and inversely for B, but C and D are stimulated by both A and B. Thus after one interation, we lose A and B, which were initially activated! However if we set gamma = 1, we get A:2 B:2 C:2 D:2 because A is stimulated by B and by A itself.

        % This will find the k-clique where k = c, in other words it will reconstruct one node at a time a clique of order c, and if it can't find such a clique, then it returns an empty message (we failed, there's no clique). If there's a clique of length c, this algorithm will find it and return it. If there are multiple cliques of length c, this algorithm will find just one and returns it, whether it's the one we are looking for or not (thus it does not handly ambiguity).
        % How it works: we consider that we are in a graph, where every node in this graph corresponds to a submessage containing a subset of the nodes of the full message. In the ascending approach, the first node is totally empty, and each subnodes has one fanal, then each subsubnodes has two fanals, then each subsubsubnodes has three fanals, etc... until at the end we get nodes where the messages contain c fanals (we can go deeper but we stop at this level since we are trying to find a kclique and not the maximum clique). Thus we can consider this problem to be a simple tree search by walking, thus as Depth-First Search or Breadth-First Search or even AStar (also called Branch and Bound, and this is what is used to find maximal clique usually).
        % Finding a k-clique is a NP-hard problem, thus this algorithm will be slow, but it's enhanced with tricks from Constraints Programming thus as backtracking and domain-elimination (if a combination of node A-B-C does not form a clique, then we avoid exploring this subtree entirely, meaning that we will avoid A-B-C-D, A-B-C-E, A-B-C-D-E, etc.).
        % Note that this is the only filtering algorithm that isn't a heuristic, since it does not use scores at all, but rather try all combinations of nodes until it finds a clique of order c. Thus, this algorithm does not suffer from spurious fanals (which have a score above correct fanals), but only suffers from spurious cliques (for this algorithm to be confused, there must be an ambiguity = two cliques of order c, so to have an ambiguity, a spurious fanal must be connected to at least (c-1) correct fanals so that it really forms a clique).
        % TODO: try to use a SAT solver, similarly to the knapsack problem? This should be a lot faster than doing it manually.

        % NOTE: on performances: one k-clique is easy enough to find and quite quick, but it's a lot harder to find multiple k-cliques, because the algorithm might get stuck in the subtree leading to only the k-clique we already found, the other k-cliques being on different subtrees altogether. To avoid this, there is a re-sort after each k-clique is just found (see just_found variable), which allows to explore altogether different subtrees as a first guess. However, this brings another harder (and hardest) case: when the different k-cliques overlap, you have to explore in the middle of the tree, and this is the hardest case since you have fanals from the already found k-clique overlapping with the next k-clique to find, thus we can't just explore an altogether different subtree, but rather the middle of the tree which is a mix between the new k-clique and the already found one.
