gbnn-matlab
===========

Gripon-Berrou Neural Network implementation in Octave 3.8.1 and also working on Matlab 2013a.

See main.m for more informations and an example of usage, or simple.m or gbnn_mini.m if you want even simpler versions to kickstart you.

This is a work-in-progress, a lot of features may be added or changed (but since the addition of named optional arguments, this shouldn't affect you and future changes should be mostly retro-compatibles).

If you want to use the GBNN network in your own application, you only need the files inside the gbnn-core/ folder. The other folders and files are just usage examples or figures.
