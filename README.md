gbnn-matlab
===========

Gripon-Berrou Neural Network implementation in Octave/Matlab.

BEWARE: this is the experimental branch, implementing the latest changes. Every commit is thoroughly tested beforehand, thus the repository should be stable most of the time but be careful.

BEWARE2: this branch has only been tested with Octave 3.8.1. Compatibility with MatLab was not tested recently but the author tried its best to write in the common subset of language that should be compatible in both MatLab and Octave. If you try this on MatLab, at worst you may have to change a few syntax here and there, but it should be mostly compatible.

See main.m for more informations and an example of usage, or simple.m or gbnn_mini.m if you want even simpler versions to kickstart you.

This is a work-in-progress, a lot of features may be added or changed (but since the addition of named optional arguments, this shouldn't affect you and future changes should be mostly retro-compatibles).
